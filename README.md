Jquery Prototype for Safe-T
SAFE-T
This app would provide crowd-sourced information to assist people in crisis situations. Hurricanes, flooding, fires, active shooters, car crashes, and any other incident could be reported to the app and a marker would appear on a map of the affected area. This would also include green “safe” zones that are not flooded or secured from whatever else may be happening. This would be done with push notifications to people in the affected area, “Flooding has been reported in your vicinity”. Avoid accidents during your commute. Emergency personnel could mark red “no-go” areas if there is an active shooter or gas leak. The app would use GPS location to alert those users of the affected area and give directions to safety. 
Intended users would be parents and working adults. Parents can set safe locations on their childs device and know that in case of an emergency, the app will be able to provide directions for the child and then parents will know where to meet them. Commuters can get accident alerts to get alternate routes to avoid the back-up.
